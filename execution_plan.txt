RUNTIME DATA FLOW
------------------

  [Browser] <--> [WebSocket] <--> [server.js (Node.js)]
                                        |
                            +-----------+----------+
                            |                      |
                    [RCON client]          [TCP Ping]
                            |              |        |
                    [MC Server]      [MC local]  [MC ext]
                    :25575 RCON      :25565 TCP   :25565 TCP

  1. The browser opens a WebSocket to the panel
  2. The panel sends log history and current state
  3. Every 10s: panel sends RCON "list" and emits players if changed
  4. Every 30s: browser calls /api/ping-servers, panel does TCP ping
  5. Each user command -> /api/command -> RCON -> response
  6. If RCON disconnects -> automatic reconnection in 5s
